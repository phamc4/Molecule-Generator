## Basic Overview

### Background
In the fields on medicine, biotechnology and pharmacology, developing a new drug from start to a finished product is a complex process which can take years and cost billions of dollars. Even before the drug development begins, building up a body of supporting evidence before selecting a target can be costly. The initial research generates data to develop a hypothesis that the inhibition or activiation of a protein or pathway will result in a therapeutic effect in a disease. The outcome of this is the selection of a target which ultimately can lead into the discovery phase in order to justify a drug discovery effort. 

Once the root/mechanism of a certain disease is discovered, identifying a compound that effectively treats the disease without serious side effects may make for a long and laborious journey. Factors to consider when looking at potential compounds is toxicity, bioavailability, and other physiochemical features.

 ### Motivation
 
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of infant mortatlity and childhood disability caused by the loss of function of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1). Motivated to expand off of my previous capstone in university, I am looking to see if a neural netwrok is able to generate novel molecules and then ultimately see if it can generate similar molecules to the newest drug in trials to treat SMA, risdiplam. In 2017, the drug spinraza by Biogen was released to treat SMA, at the price of $750,000 the first year and then $375,000 anually. For a more indepth look, I will provide a link to my research proposal below.
